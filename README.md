# Pharmaceutical Sales Risk, Stability & Profitability Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes pharmaceutical sales data with a focus on demand stability and financial risk, moving beyond traditional revenue dashboards to support risk-aware decision making.

Rather than only answering *what performed well*, the project focuses on *how reliable and exposed that performance is under demand uncertainty*.

---

## Business Questions Addressed
- Which therapeutic classes generate the most profit?
- How stable is demand across different classes?
- How much profit is at risk under a demand shock?
- Are risk insights consistent over time?

---

## Data Used
- Daily pharmaceutical sales data (core analysis for stability and risk)
- Monthly pharmaceutical sales data (long-term trend validation)

---

## Methodology
1. Reshaped wide-format sales data into a long analytical structure.
2. Applied normalized financial assumptions (unit revenue = 1, profit margin = 25%) to focus on comparative insights.
3. Calculated total revenue and profit by therapeutic class.
4. Measured demand stability using daily sales variability.
5. Simulated a 20% demand drop to quantify profit-at-risk.
6. Classified therapeutic classes using a risk vs stability portfolio framework.
7. Validated insights using long-term monthly profit trends.

## Key Insights
- A small number of therapeutic classes contribute a disproportionate share of total profit.
- High profit does not necessarily imply low financial risk.
- Stable demand reduces uncertainty but does not eliminate downside exposure.
- Volatile classes tend to have limited financial impact.
- Monthly trends confirm structural portfolio stability over time.
